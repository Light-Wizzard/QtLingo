# Qt Lingo Help

QtLingo is a Qt Application written to help with Translation files.

This Application requires a few things in order for it to work right,
it assumes your Project file name is the same for your Translation files,
and it needs to know where the folders are.

It will strip out the TS files with just the words and referrence,
then translate it and put it back in, recompile the TS files into QM files.
